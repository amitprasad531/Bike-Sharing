# Bike-Sharing
Predict bike-sharing rides
These files are my solutions for the first project of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation course. The objective was to use multiple hidden layers of a neural network with backpropagation to predict the number of bike sharing rides over a year using historical data.
Python and Tensorflow were used to program and model the network. The code is included in dlnd-your-first-neural-network.ipynb.
